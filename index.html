    >IP Address: A unique numerical identifier assigned to every device on a network for identification and location.
IPv4: Internet Protocol version 4, a 32-bit address format expressed as four decimal numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
IPv6: Internet Protocol version 6, a 128-bit address format written as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits.
Public IP Address: A globally unique and routable IP address used for communication over the internet.
Private IP Address: An IP address reserved for use within local networks and not routable on the public internet.
Static IP Address: An IP address manually assigned to a device that remains constant.
Dynamic IP Address: An IP address automatically assigned by a DHCP server that can change periodically.
Subnet Mask: A 32-bit number that divides an IP address into network and host portions.
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): A protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network settings to devices on a network.
Class A Network: IPv4 address range for very large networks with up to 16 million hosts per network (1.0.0.0-126.255.255.255).
Class B Network: IPv4 address range for medium-to-large networks with up to 65,000 hosts (128.0.0.0-191.255.255.255).
Class C Network: IPv4 address range suited for smaller networks with up to 254 hosts (192.0.0.0-223.255.255.255).
Default Gateway: A router that forwards packets from a local network to external networks, such as the internet.
NAT (Network Address Translation): A technique allowing multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address.
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing): A method to improve IP address allocation by removing fixed class boundaries and using flexible subnet masks.
Network Address: The first IP address in a subnet, which represents the entire network itself.
Broadcast Address: The last IP address in a subnet, used to send data to all devices on that subnet.
Loopback Address: A reserved address (127.0.0.1) used for testing network interfaces on the local machine.
APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing): Addresses in the 169.254.x.x range automatically assigned when a DHCP server is unavailable.
Subnetting: The process of dividing a large IP network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks (subnets).
IPv6 Unicast: An IPv6 address type for one-to-one communication, delivering a packet to a single interface.
IPv6 Multicast: An IPv6 address type for one-to-many communication, delivering a packet to multiple devices in a group.
IPv6 Anycast: An IPv6 address type for one-to-nearest communication, delivering packets to the nearest device with a matching address.
SLAAC (Stateless Address Autoconfiguration): An IPv6 feature allowing devices to configure their own IP address without a DHCP server.
IPsec (Internet Protocol Security): A security feature natively supported by IPv6, providing end-to-end encryption and authentication.
Dual Stack: A transition mechanism where devices run both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols simultaneously.
IPv6 Tunneling: A transition mechanism where IPv6 packets are encapsulated within IPv4 packets to traverse IPv4 networks.
NAT64: A transition mechanism that allows IPv6-only devices to communicate with IPv4-only services.
VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking): A technique allowing administrators to allocate subnet sizes based on specific needs, optimizing address usage.
DORA Process: The four-step DHCP process: Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge.</textarea>
